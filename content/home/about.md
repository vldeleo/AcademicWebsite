# Biography

Victoria DeLeo is a Postdoc in the Buerkle lab at the University of Wyoming through the Modelscape project. She is currently working on competing sparse models on simulated data and applying modeling methods to understanding genetic and phenotypic diversity in plants. She received her PhD from Penn State University. She studied patterns of adaptation and geneflow in tropical dry forest trees as well as phenology and phenotypic change in Arabidopsis.
