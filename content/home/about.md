# Biography

Victoria DeLeo is a Plant Biologist looking for her next role. Her most recent role was as an R&D scientist at a Controlled Environmental Agriculture start-up. She did her postdoc in the Buerkle lab at the University of Wyoming through the Modelscape project, competing sparse models on simulated data and applying modeling methods to understanding genetic and phenotypic diversity in plants. She received her PhD from Penn State University, where she studied patterns of adaptation and geneflow in tropical dry forest trees as well as phenology and phenotypic change in Arabidopsis.
