      <description>Introns are part of the dark matter of the genome- DNA sequence with an unknown purpose. Adding to the mystery, introns are sometimes lost or gained from the same gene in different lineages. We discovered that ABCB1 (an agronomically important dwarfing gene in sorghum) showed surprisingly high variation in introns among closely related species in the grass family. We extended our search to more distantly related species to get a better idea of how introns in this gene behaved through time and what features of the gene might contribute to intron instability.</description>

      <description>The influence frugivores can have on the adaption of fruit sources goes beyond selection due to feeding preferences. The behavior of dispersers can affect the direction and strength of gene flow across a landscape. I am interested in how the colonial nesting behavior of a pigeon influence the distribution of genetic diversity of preferred food trees. The White-Crowned Pigeon (Patagioenas leucocephala) is a large bodied Columbid native to the Caribbean and capable of traveling long distances over water during seasonal migration.</description>

      <description>Arabidopsis has long served as a model for basic plant biology questions. We want to use our deep understanding of Arabidopsis biology and genetics to better understand how plants function in their environment and in response to natural conditions. We compare the great natural variation in phenological traits (dormancy, flowering time) across Arabidopsis&amp;rsquo; range to dates of collection of herbarium samples to make sense of the factors controlling life history variation in the wild.</description>

      <description>Arabidopsis has long served as a model for basic plant biology questions. We want to use our deep understanding of Arabidopsis biology and genetics to better understand how plants function in their environment and in response to natural conditions. We modeled changes in phenotypes (flowering date, C:N, delta15N, delta13C) over time and in response to climate variation to study how Arabidopsis populations have reacted to environmental pressures over the last 200 years.</description>
